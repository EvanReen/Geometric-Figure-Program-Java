## Java Program to find area of Geometric figures using method Overloading

This program finds the area of square, rectangle and circle using method overloading. In this program we have three methods with same name area(), which means we are overloading area() method. By having three different implementation of area method, we are calculating the area of square, rectangle and circle.
